# AI-Powered OOTD(Outfit of The Day) Fashion App

Developed an AI-powered Outfit of the Day (OOTD) application during the AI-ATL Hackathon. The app leverages OpenAI's DALLÂ·E 3 to generate personalized fashion trend images and outfit recommendations. I integrated the Nlx.ai conversational AI platform to provide automated customer support and styling assistance.

The project showcased the potential of AI in transforming personal fashion experiences by offering intelligent, personalized styling recommendations.

## Key Achievements
- Generated fashion trend images using AI
